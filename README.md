JS Guy Fawkes game
===============

This is a js game for touchscreen devices, optimized to work on any screen size.
The project was developed during Summerschool KPI 2012 in ten days and took the first place judged by Samsung representatives and tutors from Sweden.
Because of deadline and the fact that team members had different programming experience, code is a bit messy ;)

Team lead was Anton Kasyanov.
